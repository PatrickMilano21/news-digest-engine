# Human Overrides
These ALWAYS take precedence over agent learning.

## Don't Flag (Agent Was Wrong)
<!-- Add patterns here that the agent incorrectly flagged -->
<!-- Example: `helper_function()` — Tested indirectly via integration test -->

## Always Flag (Agent Missed)
<!-- Add patterns here that the agent should always catch -->
<!-- Example: Any new API route without corresponding test_*.py coverage -->

## Corrections Log
<!-- Record when and why overrides were added -->
<!-- Example: 2026-01-30: Agent flagged X but it's tested indirectly -->
