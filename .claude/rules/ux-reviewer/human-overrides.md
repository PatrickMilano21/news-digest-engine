# Human Overrides
These ALWAYS take precedence over agent learning.

## Don't Flag (Agent Was Wrong)
<!-- Add UI patterns here that the agent incorrectly flagged -->
<!-- Example: Gray timestamp text — intentional de-emphasis, not accessibility issue -->

## Always Flag (Agent Missed)
<!-- Add UI patterns here that the agent should always catch -->
<!-- Example: Any debug/operator data visible on customer pages -->

## Corrections Log
<!-- Record when and why overrides were added -->
<!-- Example: 2026-01-30: Agent flagged low-contrast timestamp but it's intentional design -->
