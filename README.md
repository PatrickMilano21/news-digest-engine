# news-digest-engine

A small FastAPI service that will ingest news feeds, normalize/dedupe items, and produce a daily digest.
Week 0 focus: zero-friction dev loop + operability defaults (request_id, structured logs, consistent errors).

## Quickstart

### Setup
Create venv + install deps (already done locally):
- `.venv/` is the per-repo environment.

### Run tests
```powershell
make test
```
